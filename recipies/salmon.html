<h2>Salmon</h2>
    <p>
        Salmon is a delicious dish to eat if you pick the right fish
        and it's cooked properly. I prefer atlantic salmon instead of sockeye
        salmon because sockeye salmon has bones in it. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Salmon tastes great with conola oil and your favorite flavor 
        of fish seasoning on it. It tastes best
        when cooked in an oven, a grill, or on an open fire outside. Add mashed potatoes
        with butter and a glass of your favorite soda or a cool glass
        of milk and you have the perfect meal.
